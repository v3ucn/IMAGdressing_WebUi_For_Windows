### üöÄ **Key Features:**
1. **Simple Architecture**: IMAGDressing-v1 generates lifelike garments and facilitates easy user-driven scene editing.
2. **New Task, Metric, and Dataset**: Introduces the virtual dressing (VD) task, designs a comprehensive affinity metric index (CAMI), and releases the IGPair dataset.
3. **Flexible Plugin Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with extension plugins such as [IP-Adapter](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/IP-Adapter), [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet), [T2I-Adapter](https://github.com/TencentARC/T2I-Adapter), and [AnimateDiff](https://github.com/guoyww/AnimateDiff).
4. **Rapid Customization**: Allows for rapid customization within seconds without the need for additional LoRA training.

## üè∑Ô∏è  Introduction

To address the need for flexible and controllable customizations in virtual try-on systems, we propose IMAGDressing-v1. Specifically, we introduce a garment UNet that captures semantic features from CLIP and texture features from VAE. Our hybrid attention module includes a frozen self-attention and a trainable cross-attention, integrating these features into a frozen denoising UNet to ensure user-controlled editing. We will release a comprehensive dataset, IGPair, with over 300,000 pairs of clothing and dressed images, and establish a standard data assembly pipeline. Furthermore, IMAGDressing-v1 can be combined with extensions like ControlNet, IP-Adapter, T2I-Adapter, and AnimateDiff to enhance diversity and controllability.

## üéâ How to Use

### <span style="color:red">Important Reminder</span>


### 1. Random faces and poses to dress the assigned clothes 

```sh
python inference_IMAGdressing.py --cloth_path [your cloth path]
```


### 2. Random faces use a given pose to dress a given outfit 

```sh
python inference_IMAGdressing_controlnetpose.py --cloth_path [your cloth path] --pose_path [your posture path]
```

### 3. Specify the face and posture to wear the specified clothes

```sh
python inference_IMAGdressing_ipa_controlnetpose.py --cloth_path [your cloth path] --face_path [your face path] --pose_path [your posture path]
```

# webui

```
python3 app.py
```

### 4. Specify the model to wear the specified clothes (Experimental Feature)
<span style="color:red">Please download the humanparsing and openpose model file from [IDM-VTON-Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yisol/IDM-VTON/tree/main) to the ckpt folder first.</span>
```sh
